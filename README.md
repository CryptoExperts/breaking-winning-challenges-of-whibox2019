# Breaking WhibOx 2019 Winning Implementations

This repository shares part of attack results performed by [Louis Goubin](http://www.goubin.fr), [Matthieu Rivian](http://matthieurivain.com/) and [Junwei Wang](https://junwei.co/) on breaking the three following winning implementations of [WhibOx 2019](https://whibox-contest.github.io/2019/) white-box cryptography competition:

- [\#100 (hopeful_kirch)](100),
- [\#111 (goofy_lichterman)](111),
- [\#115 (elegant_turing)](115).

## Miscellany

All three implementations are due to [Biryukov](https://www.cryptolux.org/index.php/Alex_Biryukov) and [Udovenko](http://affine.group/about). We are grateful for their contributions. More information about their work on white-box cryptography are available [here](https://www.cryptolux.org/index.php/Whitebox_cryptography).
